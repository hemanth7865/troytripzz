Built TroyTripzZ, a travel website coded entirely with PHP, HTML and CSS. 
It lists tour packages, shows big picture galleries, handles enquiry forms, and sends bookings to email.
 A simple password-protected admin page lets staff add trips and update prices.
 Fast, mobile-friendly layout and clean code ease future updates easily.
